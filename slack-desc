qemu:
qemu: QEMU is a generic and open source processor emulator which achieves
qemu: good emulation speed by using dynamic translation. Qemu is capable
qemu: of emulating full system (for example PC) including a processor and
qemu: various peripherals, emulating a cpu clone (for launching Linux
qemu: processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU), or acting as a
qemu: virtualizer (via the kqemu Accelerator Module), which could be
qemu: compiled separately for the running kernel.
